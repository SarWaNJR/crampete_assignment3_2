        <em>Shimla</em>
        <p>When the temperatures skyrocket in New Delhi and other cities in North India, tourists and locals alike make
          their
          way to cooler climates in the hill stations, the most popular of which is Shimla. The cloudy weather and forested
          hillsides make for a satisfying escape from the heat, as well as a placid place to spend a weekend or more. The
          atmosphere in the hilly central part of town, where traffic is banned, is just as pleasant as the scenic
          outskirts.<br><br>
    
          While you're in the area, make a reservation on the Kalka-Shimla Railway, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The
          96.6-kilometer-long railroad, which has been running for over a century, is renowned for its stunning views and
          authentic vintage experience.</p>
