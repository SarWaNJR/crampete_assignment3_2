        <em>Darjeeling with snow-capped Khangchendzonga Mountain in the distance</em>
        <p>
          Sightseeing in India doesn't get much better than what you'll discover in Darjeeling. The hill station in West
          Bengal is beloved for its lush green tea plantations, awe-inspiring snow-capped peaks (including Khangchendzonga,
          the world's third-highest mountain), and serene Buddhist monasteries. This is the perfect place to arrange a
          mountain trek or mountain biking adventure.<br><br>
    
          One of the most popular things to do in Darjeeling is taking a ride on the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway. Powered
          by
          an antique steam locomotive, the 140-year-old "Toy Train" takes tourists on two-hour fun rides from Darjeeling to
          Ghumâ€”a journey that's regularly counted as one of the most scenic train rides in the world.
