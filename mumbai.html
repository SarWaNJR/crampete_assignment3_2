        <pre>The Gateway of India and the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai</pre>
        <p>Want to see a more cosmopolitan side of India? Head to the energetic, coastal city of Mumbaiâ€”home to
          ultra-wealthy
          entrepreneurs and the hottest Bollywood actors. Tourists are never far from five-star hotels or gourmet
          restaurants
          in this luxe city. And even if those activities are out of budget, a cruise down the beloved Marine Drive will
          make
          you feel like royalty as you catch a glimpse of the scenic coast and glamorous Art Deco buildings.<br><br>
    
          You can also see a more authentic, local side of Mumbai in the bustling "Thieves Market" or at the Churchgate
          railway station, where hundreds of thousands of homemade lunches are packed up for delivery to the city's office
          workers every day.<br>
    
          Make sure you devote a day to checking out Sanjay Gandhi National Park and exploring the 2,000-year-old Kanheri
          Cave
          carvings.</p>
