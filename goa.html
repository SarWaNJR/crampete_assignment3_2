        <p>India's not just full of big cities and holy sitesâ€”it also has incredible beaches down south in Goa. Its
          stretches
          of golden sand along the Arabian Sea offer something for every type of tourist, whether you're interested in
          hanging
          out with the backpacker crowd in laid-back beach huts or having a ritzy tropical getaway at a five-star resort.
    
          One unique part of Goa is its blend of Indian and Portuguese cultures. You'll experience the fusion throughout the
          destination, from its Baroque architecture and cathedrals to its spicy vindaloo curries and seafood dishes.</p>
