        <pre>A holy person on the Ganges River in Varanasi</pre>
        <p>One of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world, Varanasi is arguably the holiest place in India. The
          spiritual activities take place along the sacred Ganges River, where pilgrims bathe and mourners cremate recently
          deceased relatives in plain view of passersby.<br><br><br>
    
          Tourists, on the other hand, find their own flavor of spiritualism taking sunrise boat rides, releasing floral
          blessings that float on the river, and watching the fire-filled Hindu chanting ceremonies from the steep
          ghats.<br><br><br>
    
          Away from the water, the streets of the old town twist and turn like an endless maze. Legend has it that there's
          still no accurate map of Varanasi, and once you experience the labyrinthine city for yourself, you'll be inclined
          to
          believe it.</p>
