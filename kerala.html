        <pre>Houseboat in Kerala</pre><br>
        <p>Head south of Goa, and you'll trade beaches for tranquil backwaters in Kerala. Nothing beats the experience of
          hopping aboard a traditional thatched-top houseboat in Alleppey (also known as Alappuzha) and slowly floating
          through palm-fringed lagoons and rivers, either as a day trip or overnight adventure. You'll enjoy freshly cooked
          Indian cuisine on the water and breathtakingly beautiful natural sights and wildlife.
    
          Easygoing Kerala is like a breath of fresh air from the intensity of cities like New Delhi and Jaipur up north.
          Schedule some time here when you're in need of a break from the chaos.</p>
